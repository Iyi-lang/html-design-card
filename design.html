            <p>Triangles are three-sided polygons with three angles.They are the simplest polygon, known for their
                stability and strength, which makes them essential in engineering and architecture.</p>

            <p>A square is a four-sided polygon with equal sides and four right angles.It’s a type of rectangle and a
                regular quadrilateral, meaning all its sides and angles are congruent,Commonly seen in architecture.</p>

            <p>A rectangle is a four-sided polygon with opposite sides that are equal and four right angles. It’s a type
                of quadrilateral and a parallelogram, making it both symmetrical and versatile.</p>

            <p>A trapezium (or trapezoid in American English) is a four-sided polygon with at least one pair of parallel
                sides. In most definitions, the two parallel sides are called the bases,while the non-parallel sides are

            <p>A circle is a round, two-dimensional shape where all points are equidistant from a central point. With no
                sides or angles, it is a symbol of unity, infinity, and completeness. used in designs.</p>
